â€¢ Michel wants to know how many days there are between two dates. Please, help him find that number.
Use the Gregorian calendar.

- If the result is under 0 you need to return "error".
- If any date it's not valid, you need to return "Invalid Date"
Input
Line 1: The most recent date DATE1 (mm-dd-yyyy)
Line 2: The most oldest date DATE2 (mm-dd-yyyy)
Output
Line 1: A number of days
Constraints
DATE1 = date in the format (mm-dd-yyyy)
DATE2 = date in the format (mm-dd-yyyy)
Example
Input
12-13-1989
12-21-1973
Output
5836
