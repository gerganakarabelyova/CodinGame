/*

In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the 
closest to zero.

	
Sample temperatures
Here, -1 is the closest to 0.
 	Rules
Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input 
data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has 
to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures 
are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 	Game Input
Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the 
result on the standard output.
Input
Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze

Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging 
from -273 to 5526

Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the 
temperature closest to 0.
Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000
Example
Input
5
1 -2 -8 4 5
Output
1
